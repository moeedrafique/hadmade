# Bug 
///////////////////////////

- ## Error
  ![error image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgzv7gan8/image/upload/v1692038133/daniela_handmade/readme/console_errors_from_unicorn_dptenx.png)
  ![requests](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgzv7gan8/image/upload/v1692038133/daniela_handmade/readme/unicorn_error_zplkaw.png)

- ## moment of occurance
    ```
    when clicking any unicorn components buttons from **product** and **item_in_bag** components
    ```

- ## Environments it occures in 
  ```
      Production - Yes
      Localhost - No
  ```
  
- ## Cause
  ```
      Currently Unknown
  ```
- ## Possible causes:
    * Django unicorn implementation - NO, since it is working fine in localhost. 
    * Conflicts with current session that get's handled in the components
    * Conflicts between dependencies - Possible
  
- ## Repercursions:
* Due to this issue, a checksum error might occur. Checksums are strings of characters that django-unicorn uses to identify components, 
* A checksum error could have a lot of sources, but what all of them have in common is when a page get's out of Sync.  
* With the current bug I could not reproduce a checksums error by spamming the buttons for 5 minutes, but as an extra-safety measure for testing If it ever occurs, you have to delete the session_id stored in the browser application storage
  ![checksums error session_id deletion](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgzv7gan8/image/upload/v1692038110/daniela_handmade/readme/session_id_e6ffmj.png)
  
- ## Bug type
      NONFATAL
- ## Conclusion
If a button doesn't work, it can be pressed again untill it works, or the checksum error will eventualy kick in, however I couldn't obtain the checksum error by spammin the component template

# /////////////////////////// End of Bug

# /// Update on BUG
## Solved
### cause discovered:
___
Heroku is assigning only one dyno to a free hosted app, meaning that when using django-unicorn, to components are cached.
Caching in memory would only work with more than one dyno, therefore since the app has only one server, 
I could implement file-based caching in Django.
This also explains why the bug only occurred in production environment and not locally.
</br></br></br>

## Stack Overflow
* I managed to overcome a lot of issues by just going on this amazing resource with a copy paste of my errors.

## Chat GPT
* I used Chat GPT to navigate Django's main concepts, As a beginner I found it the quickest way to see how Django's Lego pieces were coming together.
* I learned to use ChatGPT mainly for general concepts rather than specifics, since it's training consists of lying and deceiving about it's current knowledge.
* Lesson I learned from Chat GPT : ```When you feel like you're chasing your tail around ChatGPT, the answer is elsewhere```
